# üåç World Happiness Data Visualization

## Project Overview
This project explores the **World Happiness Dataset** and visualizes the relationships between **Happiness Score** and various factors such as GDP, Social Support, Freedom, Life Expectancy, Generosity, and Perceptions of Corruption.  

The goal is to **understand patterns, correlations, and trends** that influence happiness across countries using **multiple data visualization techniques**.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Scatter Plot
- **Purpose:** Explore relationships between numeric features (e.g., GDP vs Happiness Score)
- **Features:**
  - Color-coded by Region
  - Log scaling for skewed features (GDP)
  - Optional annotation for top/bottom countries

## Key Insights
- GDP per Capita, Social Support, and Life Expectancy show strong positive correlation with Happiness Score.  
- Generosity has weaker correlation with Happiness.  
- Countries cluster by region: European countries generally have higher Happiness Scores, while some African countries cluster at lower scores.  
- Skewed features like GDP are better visualized on a log scale.
